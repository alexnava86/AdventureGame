# Adventure Game
'Adventure Game' is a 2D side-scrolling fantasy/sci-fi action-adventure platformer RPG, similar in gameplay to Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, but with spiritual inspirations drawn from Super Mario World, Metroid and Elden Ring, with a focus on exploration, action-adventure elements and fast paced, timing-based combat. 

In an isolated fantasy world with a buried technological past, play as a guard who stumbles upon an ancient existential threat facing their world. Explore several large overworld map areas with lots of nooks and crannies, many rich levels full of secrets and lively towns with interesting NPCs. Find weapons, abilities and power-ups throughout your journey, face off against challenging enemies and bosses, and uncover the secrets and lore of this mysterious ancient world.
