# Adventure Game
'Adventure Game' is a tentatively-titled, side-scrolling Zelda II/Metroidvania inspired action-RPG. 'Adventure Game' builds upon that basic formula with modern features, graphics, game design, gameplay and scope. Explore a mysterious world as a young soldier who stumbles upon a secret, ancient power.

'Adventure Game' is currently being developed by Ryan Elmore and Alex Nava using the Unity3D game engine, and currently has no scheduled release date. Other tools we use to manage the project include Aesprite, Tiled, Photoshop, Visual Studio, Discord and Github.
