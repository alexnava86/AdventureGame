# Adventure Game
<!--PhotoPending-->

'Adventure Game' is a 2D side-scrolling fantasy/sci-fi action-adventure platformer RPG, similar in gameplay to Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, but with spiritual inspirations drawn from Super Mario World, Metroid and Elden Ring, with a focus on exploration, action-adventure elements and fast paced, timing-based combat. 

In an isolated fantasy world with a buried technological past, play as a guard who stumbles upon an ancient existential threat facing their world. Explore several large overworld map areas with lots of nooks and crannies, many rich side-scrolling levels full of secrets and lively towns with interesting NPCs. Find weapons, abilities and power-ups throughout your journey, face off against challenging enemies and bosses, and uncover the secrets and lore of this mysterious ancient world.

'Adventure Game' is currently being developed in Unity 4.28f1, and doesn't have a release date yet, though you can play the game in its current state here. Other tools we use to manage the project include Visual Studio, GitHub, Tiled, Discord, Aesprite and Photoshop.
